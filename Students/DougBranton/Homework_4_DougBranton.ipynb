    "__c.__ These values are reasonable relative to one another. We expect for larger redshifts (locally, gets fuzzy at large z) to correlate with a larger angular diameter distance as they both measure length. And if we have a larger angular diameter distance, then by $d_A=\\frac{l}{\\theta}$ we should expect for their size to appear smaller. This is intuitive as our results find that objects viewed over larger distances appear smaller. Their ranking of distance further illustrates this given that the smallest angular diameter distance (to galaxy 1) comes from the smallest redshift, while the distance between the two is next largest and corresponds to a larger redshift and finally the largest angular diameter distance corresponds to the largest redshift."
